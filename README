// Please follow the steps while implementing homo_rect.py//

Pick the points you want to fix: In the code, src_points are the four corners in the original frame that you want to straighten out. You could set these manually (by clicking on corners or from known marker positions) or detect them automatically (for example, with a corner-detection algorithm).

Decide where those points should end up: In dst_points, you define what shape or size you want these corners to become in the final (rectified) image. For a rectangle, choose a width and height (for example, 300×200).

Compute the transform: The cv2.getPerspectiveTransform function calculates the matrix that “warps” the original region so it appears straight in the new image.

Apply the transform to each video frame: The cv2.warpPerspective function uses that matrix to correct each frame so the selected region looks flat.

Adjust the output: The code saves the corrected frames as a video file. You can change the file name, codec, frame rate, or simply display the frames without saving.
